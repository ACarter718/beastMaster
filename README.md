This is a project that I'm working on to "take a stab" at an online educational playground to supplement learning objectives and gamification in my high school classroom.  

As of Jan 6, 2018, the site and it's components are primarily authored in PHP because my shared host won't let me use Node.js.  It is currently hosted at http://cartersworld.website/src/

Future goals include:

create a currency system
create an accounting system to track account balances and transactions
setup a store
user accounts 
login with Google
